Development
-----------

This extension's codebase is developed to support both Firefox and Chrome browser extension APIs.

Before going into development, you will need latest NodeJS (tested on v6-8) installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

And finally

```bash
npm run build
```

To bundle versions of extension for different browsers. They will go to `build` folder ready-to-use.

Note: Microsoft Edge does not support moving tabs in its extension API at the time of extension 
creation, so sadly no Edge :(
