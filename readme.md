Development
-----------

This extension's codebase is developed to support multiple browser extension APIs.

Before going into development, you will need latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (tested on v6-8)
installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

After making changes to sources, build the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle extension for different browsers. They will go to `build` directory ready-to-use.

Note: Microsoft Edge does not support moving tabs in its extension API at the time of extension 
creation, so sadly no Edge :(
